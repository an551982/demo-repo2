git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit demo2"

# push to github
# cannot use git push now because github has not remote of this yet
# create it on github, use one of two
# 1.1 create a new repo "demo-repo2" on github, copy the link
# 1.2 add reference on commandline:
        % git remote add origin <remote git repo link>
        % git remote -v
        % git push origin master
        or with -u to set up default repo and then later no need to type out origin master
        % git push -u origin master
        later you can use "% git push -u" to push to the same repo
